}
\arguments{
\item{x}{df or vector (char or factor of char)}

\item{cols}{evaluated as cols=ez.selcol(x,cols), ignored if x is a vector}

\item{recodes}{vector with three elements corresponding to (minor-minor, minor-major or major-minor, major-major). Could be c(0,1,2), c(2,1,0), c(-1,0,1), c(1,2,3), c(0,1,1), c(1,0,0), c('AA','AB','BB')}
}
\value{
returns a new df or vector. Regardless of input data type, if recodes are number, then the returned is also numeric; if recodes are char, then always factor of char.
}

}
\note{
assume biallelic, otherwise error. minor/major bases are calculated based on the actual input data
